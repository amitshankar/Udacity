# README

This is the first project of term one in the data analyst nandegree program. Project 01 deals with exploring the temperature dataset of San Francisco using 7 day moving average and 14 day moving average. The project was done originally in ms excel. The data was acquired by querying a sql database hosted on Udacity's intrapages. The pdf of the project is available [here](https://github.com/amitshankar/Udacity/blob/master/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/Term_01/Project_01/writeup.pdf). The dataset and graphs rendered in the pdf are embeded in the excel worksheet called "graph.xlsx" located [here](https://github.com/amitshankar/Udacity/tree/master/Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/Term_01/Project_01).

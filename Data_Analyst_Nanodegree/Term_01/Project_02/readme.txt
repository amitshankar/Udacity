Improvements from suggestions from first submission:
1. Reading only one file instead of all the files into memory.
2. Included a display function to display 5 lines at a time.
3. Not throwing an error when user enters ChiCAgo instead of Chicago.
4. For gender and birth calculations, checking the column names.

Remember to follow [the instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub?embedded=True) and review the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/71/view) before submitting. Once you\\'ve completed the analysis and write-up, download this file as a PDF or HTML file, upload that PDF/HTML into the workspace here (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left then Upload), then use the Submit Project button at the bottom of this page. This will create a zip file containing both this .ipynb doc and the PDF/HTML doc that will be submitted for your project.\\n@@@\\n@@@\\n@@@(1) What is the independent variable? What is the dependent variable?\\n@@@\\n@@@**Answer**<br>\\n@@@Dependent variables are the congruent and incongruent times.<br>\\n@@@Independent variables are word and color combination of text that is shown to the participants, also the size and type of fonts used.\\n@@@\\n@@@(2) What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? Specify your null and alternative hypotheses, and clearly define any notation used. Justify your choices.\\n@@@\\n@@@**Answer**<br>\\n@@@Two tail test is ideal when direction is not important. In this case, the null hypothesis could be that mean congruent time is equal to mean incongruent time. The alternate hypothesis is that the mean congruent time is not equal to incongruent time.\\n@@@\\n@@@\\n@@@$$H_0: \\\\mu_{congruent} - \\\\mu_{incongruent} = 0$$\\n@@@$$H_0: \\\\mu_{congruent} - \\\\mu_{incongruent} \\\\neq 0$$\\n@@@\\n@@@**$\\\\mu_{congruent}$  and  $\\\\mu_{incongruent}$ are population mean.**\\n@@@\\n@@@** $\\\\alpha$ = 0.05  (threshold of type 1 error)**\\n@@@\\n@@@Degrees of freedom = 24-1=23\\n@@@\\n@@@Assumption: Since the same candidate is taking the congruent and incongruent test, I am assuming that the two are related ( the candidate is the same just the test is different).\\n@@@\\n@@@(3) Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset.

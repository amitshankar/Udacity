    "The twitter-archive-enhanced.csv was saved to the local directory by clicking the following link https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv and saving the corresponding csv file in the local working directory. This was a manual process and not scaleable. This process could be made more efficient by directly passing the url to the pandas read csv function eg. \n",

    "The image_predictions.tsv was programmatically downloaded from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv using the requests funciton in conjunction with file.write function. This is very scaleable becuase it allows for setting dynamic filenames by extracting file names from the url and saving the content to specific file name. The mode='wb' allows for saving files individually but by setting mode='a', we can append content from numerous files into one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading Twitter data via Twitter API and tweepy library was a lengthy learning process. First set the consumer and access token/keys. Used a json parser by setting tweepy.API(parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser()) becuase twitter data is stored in json format and the json parser allows for converting to downloaded data in json format. Once the data is in json format, it is appended to  tweet_json.txt file in the working directory. After the data is saved to working directory, it is then read back into memory as a python list. Each element in the list is converted back into a json format and revelant data is extracted such as tweet id, favorites count and retweet count.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to save each tweet's complete data to the file and read it back to extract info because it saves time in the future to re-read the data from file than to read the data from twitter's website.\n",

    "api.get_status(tweet_mode='extended')\n",

    "\n",
    "**Some important takeaways:** \n",
    "1. It is helpful to name dataframes with extenion df_***, so typing a dataframe name, we can type 'df' and autocomplete can show a drop down list of dataframes for us to choose from.\n",
    "2. It is also helpful to paste the json format tweet in sublime text to see the indents in the text and this is very helpful when extracting  values from multilevel lists.\n",

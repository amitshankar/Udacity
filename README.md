## Course work from Udacity

Currently, I am taking the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity and am in term 02. This repo contains subfolders in the following hierarchy:  

### Data_Analyst_Nanodegree  
* **Term_01**
  * Project_01  
  * Project_02  
  * Project_03
* **Term_02**
  * Project_01  

I frequently update this repo with more content as I progress in learning more about Data.
